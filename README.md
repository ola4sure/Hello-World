  -The main differences between var, let and const keywords.
  -The binding declared with "var" is visible throughtout the whole function that it appear in -or throughout the global scope,
  -if it is not in a function.
  -while binding declared with "let" is only visible within the block except if it was declared globally.
  -also "const keyword" is to makes a function or variable to be fixed throughtout the program.
  -For that of anomalous function expressions which could be improved with a lexical name.
  -Because the set of bindings visible inside a block is determined by the place of that block in the program text.
  -Each local scope can also see all the local scopes that it, and all scopes can see the global scope.
(2)
  -The best way to describe to a coworker or boss to improve readability is to include "statements to the codes" 
  -for the main change made or contributed in the program text.
